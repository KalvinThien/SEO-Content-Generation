			<h2>FAQs:</h2>

			<h3>Q: How do I Choose the Right Size Sofa for My Living Room?</h3>
			<p>A: Consider the size of your room and other furniture pieces in it. You want to choose a sofa that is proportional to the space. A too big sofa will make the room feel cramped, while a too small one will look out of place. Measure your room before shopping for a sofa, and don't forget to take into account doorways and hallways that the sofa will have to pass through.</p>

			<h3>Q: Is Leather Sofa Maintenance Difficult?</h3>
			<p>A: No, maintaining a leather sofa is easy if you follow some simple guidelines. Wipe it clean with a damp cloth regularly and condition it with leather care products once or twice a year. Avoid exposing it to direct sunlight and keep it away from heat sources like radiators or fireplaces.</p>

			<h3>Q: Are All Leather Sofas Made Equal?</h3>
			<p>A: No, not all leather sofas are made equal. The quality of leather used, the frame material, and manufacturing process can greatly affect the sofa's durability and comfort levels. Always choose reputable manufacturers who use premium materials and follow strict quality control measures.</p>

			<h3>Q: How Much Should I Expect to Pay for Quality Leather Sofa?</h3>
			<p>A: The price of a quality leather sofa can vary depending on several factors such as the manufacturer, size, style, and material used. Expect to pay anywhere from RM 3,000 to RM 20,000 for a well-made leather sofa that will provide long-lasting comfort and style. It's essential to invest in a quality piece that will serve you well for years instead of settling for a cheap, poorly made sofa that may fall apart in a short period.</p>
