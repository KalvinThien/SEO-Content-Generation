As an AI language model, I can provide suggestions for optimizing the website's content with long-tail keywords. Here are some examples:

- Affordable chair manufacturers in Kuala Lumpur
- Custom chair design and manufacturing services
- Chair repair and refurbishment in Malaysia
- Chair upholstery and reupholstery solutions
- High-quality chair manufacturing materials
- Skilled craftsmen for chair production
- Competitive pricing for chair manufacturing 
- Customizable chair designs for different needs 
- Furniture retailers in Malaysia 
- Interior designers in Kuala Lumpur 
- Office managers in Malaysia 
- Hospitality industry furniture solutions 

You can use these keywords to optimize the website's content by including them in the headings, paragraphs, and meta tags. However, make sure to use them naturally and avoid keyword stuffing, which can harm your website's ranking.
