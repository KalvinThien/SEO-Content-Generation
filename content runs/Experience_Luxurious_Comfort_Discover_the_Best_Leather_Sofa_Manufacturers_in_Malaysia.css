Sure, here's an example of how you can add animations to your website using the AOS and Animate.css libraries:

```css
/* Import the AOS and Animate.css libraries */
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aos@2.3.4/dist/aos.css');
@import url('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css');

/* Set the animation for a specific tag */
h1 {
  animation: animate__animated animate__bounceInLeft;
}

/* Set the animation duration and delay */
h1 {
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-delay: 0.5s;
}

/* Set the animation for multiple tags */
h2, p {
  animation: animate__animated animate__fadeIn;
}

/* Set the animation duration and delay for multiple tags */
h2, p {
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-delay: 1s;
}

/* Set the animation for a tag using AOS */
div {
  opacity: 0;
  animation: none;
}

/* Set the AOS animation type and duration */
div[data-aos="fade-up"] {
  opacity: 1;
  animation: fade-up 1s ease-in-out;
}

/* Define the fade-up animation */
@keyframes fade-up {
  from {
    transform: translateY(50px);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

In this example, we're importing the AOS and Animate.css libraries to add animations to our website. We're setting the animation for specific tags like h1, h2, and p using the Animate.css classes like animate__animated and animate__bounceInLeft. We're also setting the animation duration and delay for these tags to control the timing of the animations.

We're using AOS to set the animation for a specific tag like div and defining the animation type and duration using CSS keyframes. We're also setting the opacity to 0 initially and then animating it to 1 using the fade-up animation. These animations will help make the website more engaging and interactive for the users.
