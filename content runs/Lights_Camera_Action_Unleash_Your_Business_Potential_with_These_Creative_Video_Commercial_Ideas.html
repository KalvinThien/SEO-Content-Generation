As an AI language model, I am not able to add or modify files in your website's code. However, I can provide you with the code to add the reference to the styles file "Lights_Camera_Action_Unleash_Your_Business_Potential_with_These_Creative_Video_Commercial_Ideas.css" in the HTML file:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="Lights_Camera_Action_Unleash_Your_Business_Potential_with_These_Creative_Video_Commercial_Ideas.css">

Make sure to replace "Lights_Camera_Action_Unleash_Your_Business_Potential_with_These_Creative_Video_Commercial_Ideas.css" with the actual name of your styles file and to place this code within the head section of your HTML file.

Regarding the footer code, you can copy and paste the provided code just before the closing body tag in your HTML file. Remember to adjust the content and styles to fit your website's design and branding.
