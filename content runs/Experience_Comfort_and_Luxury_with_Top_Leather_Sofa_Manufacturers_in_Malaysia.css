Sure, I can help you add animations to your CSS file using the styles from AOS and Animate.css. Here are the steps:

1. Go to https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/ and https://animate.style/ to browse through the available animations.

2. Choose the animation you want to use and copy the CSS code for that animation.

3. In your CSS file, add the following code to import the AOS library:

   ```
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aos@2.3.4/dist/aos.css" />
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aos@2.3.4/dist/aos.js"></script>
   ```

4. Add the following code to initialize AOS:

   ```
   <script>
     AOS.init();
   </script>
   ```

5. To apply the animation to a tag, add the class name for the animation to the tag. For example:

   ```
   <h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce">Hello World!</h1>
   ```

   Replace "animate__bounce" with the class name for the animation you want to use.

6. Save your CSS file and refresh your website to see the animations in action.

I hope this helps you add animations to your website using AOS and Animate.css. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
