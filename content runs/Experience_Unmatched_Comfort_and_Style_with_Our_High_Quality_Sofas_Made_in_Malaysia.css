Sure, here's an example of how you can add animations to your website using the AOS and Animate.css libraries:

```css
/* Import the AOS and Animate.css libraries */
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aos@2.3.4/dist/aos.css');
@import url('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css');

/* Set the animation properties */
h1 {
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-name: animate__animated animate__bounceInLeft;
}

p {
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-name: animate__animated animate__fadeIn;
}

/* Initialize the AOS library */
[data-aos] {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 1s ease-in-out;
}

/* Set the AOS animation properties */
[data-aos].aos-animate {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

In this example, we're importing the AOS and Animate.css libraries to add animations to our website. We're setting the animation properties for the heading and paragraph elements using the Animate.css classes. We're also initializing the AOS library and setting the animation properties for elements with the `data-aos` attribute. You can adjust the animation properties and classes to fit your website's branding and style.
