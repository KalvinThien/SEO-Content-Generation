orry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to the CSS file you mentioned. However, I can provide you with some general tips on how to improve the alignment of a website to make it look more professional:

1. Use a grid system: A grid system can help you align your content in a consistent and organized way. You can use frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation to implement a grid system.

2. Use white space: White space can help create a clean and uncluttered look. Make sure to use enough white space between elements to give them room to breathe.

3. Use consistent margins and padding: Consistent margins and padding can help create a sense of balance and harmony on your website. Make sure to use the same margins and padding for similar elements throughout your website.

4. Use a consistent font size and style: Using a consistent font size and style can help create a cohesive look and feel for your website. Make sure to choose a font that is easy to read and matches the tone of your website.

5. Use a consistent color scheme: Using a consistent color scheme can help create a unified look and feel for your website. Make sure to choose colors that complement each other and match the tone of your website
