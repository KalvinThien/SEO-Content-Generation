I apologize for the confusion, but it seems like there was a misunderstanding. The instructions you provided are for adding custom fonts to a website, not for adding animations using the styles_files from AOS and animate.style.

To add animations using AOS and animate.style, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the AOS and animate.css files from their respective websites and add them to your website's CSS folder.

2. Link the AOS and animate.css files to your HTML file by adding the following code to the head section:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/aos.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/animate.css">
```

Replace "path/to/" with the actual path to the CSS files on your website.

3. Add the "data-aos" attribute to the HTML tags you want to animate. For example, to animate a heading, you can use the following code:

```
<h1 data-aos="fade-up">Heading</h1>
```

4. Initialize AOS by adding the following code to your JavaScript file:

```
AOS.init();
```

This will activate the AOS animations on your website.

5. To add animations from animate.css, add the class name of the animation to the HTML tag you want to animate. For example, to animate a button with a bounce animation, you can use the following code:

```
<button class="animate__animated animate__bounce">Button</button>
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
