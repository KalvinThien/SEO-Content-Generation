Sure, here's an example of how you can add animations to a website using the AOS and Animate.css libraries:

```css
/* Import the AOS and Animate.css libraries */
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/aos@2.3.4/dist/aos.css');
@import url('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css');

/* Set the animation properties */
h1 {
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-delay: 0.5s;
  animation-name: animate__fadeInDown;
}

/* Set the AOS properties */
p {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

/* Set the AOS data attributes */
p[data-aos="fade-up"] {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(20px);
  transition-delay: 0.2s;
}
```

In this example, we're importing the AOS and Animate.css libraries to add animations to our website. We're setting the animation properties for the h1 element to fade in from the top with a duration of 1 second and a delay of 0.5 seconds. We're also setting the AOS properties for the p element to have an initial opacity of 0 and a transition of 0.5 seconds with ease-in-out timing. Finally, we're setting the AOS data attributes for the p element to fade up with a delay of 0.2 seconds and a translation of 20 pixels on the Y-axis. These animations will help make the website more engaging and interactive for users.
