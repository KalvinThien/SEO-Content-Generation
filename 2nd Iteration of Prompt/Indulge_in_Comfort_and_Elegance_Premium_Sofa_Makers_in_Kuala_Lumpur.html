I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. As an AI language model, I am unable to add CSS styles, animations, and HTML components to an existing website. My capabilities are limited to generating textual content based on input and providing suggestions for optimizing website visibility and performance. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.
