I apologize for the confusion, but it seems like there was a misunderstanding in your request. You asked for help in adding animations to your website using the AOS and Animate.css libraries, not for adding a unique font and background color.

To add animations using the AOS library, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the AOS library from https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/ and include it in your website's HTML file.

2. In your website's CSS file, add the following code to apply the AOS animations to your HTML elements:

   ```
   [data-aos] {
     transition-duration: 1s;
   }
   ```

   This code sets the duration of the animation to 1 second. You can adjust this value to make the animation faster or slower.

3. Add the "data-aos" attribute to the HTML elements you want to animate. For example:

   ```
   <h1 data-aos="fade-up">Hello, world!</h1>
   ```

   This code applies the "fade-up" animation to the "h1" element.

To add animations using the Animate.css library, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the Animate.css library from https://animate.style/ and include it in your website's HTML file.

2. In your website's CSS file, add the following code to apply the Animate.css animations to your HTML elements:

   ```
   .animated {
     animation-duration: 1s;
     animation-fill-mode: both;
   }
   ```

   This code sets the duration of the animation to 1 second and ensures that the element retains its final state after the animation is complete.

3. Add the "animated" class and the desired animation class to the HTML elements you want to animate. For example:

   ```
   <h1 class="animated bounce">Hello, world!</h1>
   ```

   This code applies the "bounce" animation to the "h1" element.

I hope this helps you add animations to your website using the AOS and Animate.css libraries. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
